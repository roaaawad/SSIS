# SSIS
SSIS project utilizes the [sourceconfig] control table to store links of source files from the "whoisdomain" website:Datafeed files | Specifications | WHOIS Database Download | WhoisXML API. This website hosts a public database containing information gathered during domain name registrations or updates to DNS settings. The project involves downloading these files as ZIP archives, using the Execute Process Task to unzip them by providing the link to "7z.exe," a file archiver capable of uncompressing the files and generating Excel sheets. Subsequently, data from the sheets is loaded into the Whois database in the [whoisdomaininfor] table. Finally, a backup folder is created, and both Excel sheets and ZIP files are transferred to the backup folder, with the backup date included in the folder name.
